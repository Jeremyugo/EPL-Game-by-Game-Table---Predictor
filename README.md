# EPL-Game-by-Game-Table---Predictor

This is an interesting data science project i have always wanted to work on.

The sole purpose of this project is to figure out a way to predict the outcome of a football game, and based on the cummulation of outcomes, predict the final table of the English premier league (EPL).
If you are a fan of the beautiful game; and its called football not soccer, you would know football games, especially in the EPL are unpredictable due to numerous factors that influence these games. So it was interesting and sometimes frustrating coming up with a lot of features i thought could help my model make somewhat accurate predictions.

My final model was able to achieve about ~70% accuracy on previous football games, so i am in a way content with the model. As you'll see if you go through the notebook, a lot of tweaks had to be made, for personal reasons mostly. If you decide to work on something similar, who knows you could probably make better features, tweaks and train a more accurate model, just like i did with the information i found online when working on this project.

Thank you
